With Gauntlt you can store additional step definitions  in the attack_adapters directory.
Gauntlt also provides flexibility through a few generic step definitions that allow you to 
check the output of arbitrary raw command lines. 

Sample Gauntlt Hello world example:

Background:
@final
Feature: hello world with gauntlt using the generic command line attack
  Scenario: Check for the existence of the root user in /etc/passwd
   When I launch a "generic" attack with:
   """
   cat /etc/passwd
   """
   Then the output should contain:
   """
   root
   """
Tags:
The @slow tag tells Gauntlt to allow for a 30-second timeout.
The @veryslow allows for a five-minute timeout.
Anything witht he @ is a tag in gauntlt and it is one way to organize your attacks.
Feel free to mix in tags that have origanizational meaning like @prod with tags that describe
attack type, lke @web.


Feature:
Each attack should say what it is doing. We use the Feature keyword to express what the attack is doing,
but take this space to give a good description to what you are doing in this attack.
