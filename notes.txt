sqlmap
zap
sslyze

look thorugh each of them, do they have an api that is barely functional that people are using
the answer to a few 
is it scriptable
what does it do
how commonly is it used this way, if possible

look at command line tools
keep in mind runtime, 
burpscanner - 30 minutes to run (may not be a good fit for this)
sslyze - 1 minute or so

don't want me to spend weeks of time researching tool (take a very short time figuring out what you want to look into)
if at end of the week, we can come back and talk about it.
