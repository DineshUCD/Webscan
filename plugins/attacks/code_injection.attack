Feature: Look for SQL injections using arachni against a URL

Scenario: Using arachni, look for SQL injections and verify no issues are found

  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
      | name      | environment_variable_name |
      | path      | CURRENT_DIRECTORY         |  
      | url       | URL                       |
   And the following profile:
     | name                | value                          |
     | test                | *                              |
     | filename            | arachni_tests                  |
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """

arachni --checks=<test> <url> --report-save-path=<path>/temporary/<filename>.afr

 """
Then the output should contain " "

When I launch an "arachni" attack with:

"""
arachni_reporter <path>/temporary/<filename>.afr --reporter=xml:outfile=<path>/temporary/<filename>.xml

"""
Then the output should contain " "
